# Coordinating parallel sessions in Claude desktop — runbook

How the procedure [`platform/procedures/coordinate.md`](../../platform/procedures/coordinate.md) is run for this repo today: a coordinator session in the Claude desktop app (Code tab) starts one worker session per ticket. Until M2: Self-hosting: andy-intelligence builds itself, this is how several tickets get built at once. The procedure holds the rules; this page holds only what is specific to the app and this repo.

| Term        | Meaning                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Coordinator | The session Andy talks to. Starts workers, reads their PRs, tells Andy what to merge. Pinned, so auto-archive never closes it. |
| Worker      | A session started by the coordinator for one ticket, in its own git worktree, on its own branch.                               |
| Upkeep      | A small worker with no worktree that only moves, cancels and answers on tickets over MCP.                                      |

## 1. Start a coordinator (Andy)

New session in this repo, then pin it. First message, with the milestone filled in:

> Coordinate M<N>: <title> for andy-intelligence. Follow `platform/procedures/coordinate.md` and `docs/runbooks/coordinating-sessions.md`. Read `docs/build-log.md`, the latest handover entry in `docs/build-log/`, the MCP `status` overview and the open PRs, then propose the first batch.

A new session gets the MCP connector's current tools. A long-lived one keeps the tool list from the day it started: if `move_ticket` or `cancel_ticket` is missing, start a new coordinator or an upkeep worker rather than working around it.

## 2. Settings that matter

| Setting                                    | Value                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Auto-archive sessions when their PR closes | On (Settings → Claude Code). A worker is archived when its PR merges, so its PR must be complete. |
| Worker model and effort                    | Opus 5.5, medium, for building. Sonnet, low, for upkeep.                                          |
| Auto-fix on the coordinator's own PRs      | On per PR, when Andy says so.                                                                     |

## 3. What the coordinator does that the procedure doesn't say

- **Tickets first, over MCP:** `create_ticket` with the milestone epic as `parentId` (AI-21: M1, AI-22: M2, AI-23: M3). Refine runs on each new ticket and may ask questions; a worker builds from the ticket and brief, not from those answers.
- **Reserve ADR numbers** in each brief; the next free number is the highest in `docs/architecture/adr/README.md` plus those already handed out.
- **Owned by the coordinator:** the milestone map in `docs/build-log.md` and `context-budget.json` budgets. Workers add only their own `docs/build-log/<date>-<slug>.md`.
- **Budgets:** architecture detail goes in the topic files (ADR-0061); a worker replaces the as-built lines it supersedes. A budget is raised only when Andy agrees, in a PR he merges.
- **After each merge:** `gh run list --branch main` for the checks on `main`; message every open worker; send the upkeep worker any ticket the PR event did not move.
- **Workers waiting on Andy** (a permission prompt inside the session) are named to him and left alone.
- **Infra:** a PR that needs `terraform apply` or a deploy sequence says so in its description; Andy applies locally, per root, with the expected counts (`infra/AGENTS.md`).

## 4. Hand over

Between batches, the coordinator writes `docs/build-log/<date>-handover-<milestone>.md` (merged, open, waiting on Andy, next batch) in a docs PR, and Andy starts the next coordinator with the message in §1.
